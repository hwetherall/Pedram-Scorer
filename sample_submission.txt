### **Discover: Who I Am**

**What sparks joy in my life?**
For me, joy is found in the process of creation and problem-solving. I feel a deep sense of well-being and elation when I'm working on a complex coding challenge and finally see it work. Another source of joy is mentoring junior developers; seeing them grasp a concept I've explained is incredibly rewarding.

**My Greatest Passions & Goals**
My greatest passion is using technology to build communities. My long-term goal is to create a platform that connects non-profit organizations with skilled tech volunteers, streamlining their operations and amplifying their impact.

**My Superhero**
My role model is Dr. Aran, a character from the sci-fi novel "The Stardust Architect." She is a brilliant scientist and a compassionate leader who always prioritizes ethical considerations and the well-being of her team over personal gain. She is known for her resilience in the face of immense challenges and her unwavering belief in a better future.

**Shared Values**
Like Dr. Aran, I hold the values of integrity, curiosity, and compassion in high regard. I strive to approach my work with the same ethical rigor and to lead with empathy. I aspire to develop her level of resilience and her ability to inspire and unite people toward a common, positive goal.

### **Future Map: My Vision**

**My Ideal Day**
My ideal day starts with two hours of deep, uninterrupted work on my non-profit platform project. The rest of the morning is spent collaborating with a small, mission-driven team. In the afternoon, I would dedicate time to learning a new skill, like data visualization, followed by a long walk in nature to decompress and think.

**Fulfilling My Dreams**
This ideal day directly contributes to my dream of building a successful and impactful tech-for-good organization. The balance of focused work, collaboration, learning, and reflection is the engine that will drive this vision forward.

**Where I'll Be**
I hope to spend significant time in three cities known for their vibrant tech scenes and connection to social causes: Berlin, Germany; Austin, Texas; and Kyoto, Japan.

### **Design: Go-To-Market Strategy**

**My Story & Value Proposition**
My story is that of a software engineer who believes that technology's greatest promise is to empower those who are working to make the world better. My value proposition is to provide non-profits with access to top-tier technical talent and custom-built tools they could not otherwise afford, enabling them to operate more efficiently and effectively.

**Target Audience & Positioning**
My target audience is small to medium-sized non-profit organizations. I will communicate my value proposition through a positioning statement: "For non-profits struggling with outdated technology, our platform provides the expert volunteers and custom software to amplify your impact, because your mission deserves a world-class digital toolkit."

### **Execution: Making it Happen**

**Career Opportunities**
I am considering opportunities in product management at socially conscious tech companies to gain experience in scaling a platform. I am also exploring opportunities to contribute to major open-source projects that align with my mission.

**Skills to Improve**
I need to improve my financial modeling skills to create a sustainable business plan. I will commit to:
1.  Taking an online course on financial modeling for startups.
2.  Finding a mentor with experience in non-profit finance.
3.  Building financial models for three different hypothetical projects.

**Conquering Challenges**
The biggest challenge will be creating a model that is sustainable without charging the non-profits. I'll need to conquer this by building strong partnerships with corporate sponsors who believe in the mission and are willing to fund the operational costs in exchange for corporate social responsibility opportunities.
