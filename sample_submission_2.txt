Discover: Who I Am

What sparks joy in my life?
I feel most alive when I’m facilitating moments of clarity for others—turning confusion into momentum. Coaching early-stage founders, shipping small tools that remove drudgery, and teaching workshops where teams leave with a shared vocabulary bring me consistent joy.

Greatest passions and goals
My passion is building humane AI assistants that free people from repetitive tasks. My long‑term goal is to launch a cooperative studio that creates open‑source, privacy‑first copilots for social impact organizations.

Role model
My role model is Dr. Fei‑Fei Li for her blend of technical excellence and principled vision about human‑centered AI. I admire her courage to steer the field toward responsibility and inclusion while still doing world‑class research.

Values I share & who I aspire to be
Values: curiosity, service, and stewardship. I aspire to become a leader who is calm under uncertainty, candid about trade‑offs, and generous with credit.

A wake‑up call
Two years ago I burned out trying to be a lone hero at a nonprofit. The experience forced me to slow down, delegate, and design processes that sustain people as much as products. That shift changed how I scope work and how I treat success.

Future Map: My Vision

Ideal day
Mornings are for two hours of deep work on research or prototyping; mid‑day for pair sessions with teammates and stakeholders; late afternoon for user interviews or docs; evenings reserved for a run and time with friends.

Fulfilling my biggest dreams
I will build a cooperative studio that ships small, high‑quality tools that compound in value. I’ll earmark Fridays for learning—reading papers, exploring libraries, and writing public notes.

Where I’ll live and work
I plan to split time between: Lisbon (tight remote‑tech network and renewable‑energy culture), Montreal (ethics‑AI community), and Taipei (strong civic‑tech scene).

People I’ll work with & mutual help
I want to work with operators and researchers who value rigor and kindness. I help them by translating fuzzy ideas into tractable steps; they help me by pressure‑testing assumptions and holding a high bar for evidence.

Why this matters
I watched mission‑driven teams drown in spreadsheets and copy‑paste. Giving them dignified tools creates time for care work and community building.

Design: Go‑To‑Market

My story
I’m an engineer‑turned‑facilitator who builds tiny tools that remove big friction. I specialize in stitching together reliable pipelines with thoughtful UX, then teaching teams how to own them.

Target audience
Small to midsize nonprofits and civic‑tech teams that handle sensitive data, value transparency, and want to automate without surveillance.

Value proposition
Privacy‑first copilots that automate repetitive workflows (intake triage, grant reporting, case notes) while keeping humans in the loop. Impact: fewer hours on paperwork, faster response times, higher data quality.

Positioning & communication
“Human‑centered automation for teams that care.” I’ll publish open playbooks, run live build‑along sessions, and share metrics dashboards that make results legible.

Why customers would choose us
We’re cooperative, open by default, and optimize for reliability over flash. We teach teams to maintain their tools instead of locking them into black boxes.

BONUS (customer interview)
I interviewed a program manager at a housing nonprofit who described spending 12 hours/month on eligibility summaries. We prototyped a note‑to‑summary assistant that cut the task to 2 hours while improving consistency.

Execution: Make It Happen

Opportunities I’m considering
(1) Partnering with two nonprofits to co‑develop pilots; (2) A fellowship to research auditability for AI assistants; (3) A part‑time role at an open‑source foundation.

New domain & networks
I want to deepen expertise in document intelligence and secure data flows. I’ll meet founders in the Open Data, Civic Tech, and Effective Institutions communities.

Skill to improve & three commitments
Skill: causal inference in product metrics. Commitments: complete an online course, replicate three classic studies with public datasets, and present learnings to peers for critique.

How opportunities advance the vision
Pilots generate grounded case studies and reusable templates; the fellowship yields research‑backed patterns; the foundation role amplifies distribution.

Challenges I must overcome
Funding early work without compromising mission; aligning privacy constraints with model capabilities; and hiring for values fit.

BONUS (contacts/commitments)
I’ve scheduled three conversations with nonprofit ops leaders and committed to sharing a pilot template publicly within six weeks.

Overall Quality

Book/framework usage
I’m applying concepts from “The Systems Bible” (Gall) and “Good Strategy/Bad Strategy” (Rumelt): focus on the kernel (diagnosis, guiding policy, coherent actions), and design small systems that fail safely.

Length & mechanics
This document is within the suggested limit. I’ve proofread for clarity and cohesion and included concrete commitments.
